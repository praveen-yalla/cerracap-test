                        This website does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy the company’s securities. In making an investment decision, investors must rely on their own examination of the company, including the merits and risks involved.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Recipients should not construe the contents of this website as legal, tax or financial advice. Each recipient should consult his, her or its own professional advisors as to the legal, tax, financial or other matters relevant to the suitability of an investment
                        in the company for such recipient.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The company and its general partner make no express or implied representation or warranty as to the accuracy or completeness of the information in this website or, in the case of projections, as to their attainability or the accuracy or completeness of
                        the assumptions from which they are derived. It is expected that you will pursue your own independent investigation concerning any potential transaction with the company. You should recognize that the projections of the company’s
                        future performance are necessarily subject to a high degree of uncertainty, and actual results may vary materially from the projections. The general partner of the company hereby extends to you the opportunity to ask questions
                        of, and receive answers from, representatives of the company concerning this website and to obtain any additional information to the extent it can be obtained without unreasonable effort or expense, in order to verify the accuracy
                        of the information set forth herein. However, all such additional information must be in writing and identified as such by the company’s representatives.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This website is intended solely for use on a confidential basis by those persons to whom or which it is transmitted by the company’s representatives. You must keep this website and its contents confidential. By accepting this presentation, you agree not
                        to disclose to any person or entity any information concerning the company, or any of the terms, conditions or other facts with respect to any possible future transactions with the company. By accepting this presentation, you agree
                        to keep permanently confidential the contents of this presentation and information made available in connection with any further investigation of the company, and not to use such information for any purpose other than intended.
                        You may not photocopy, reproduce or distribute this presentation to any other person or entity at any time without the prior written consent of the company’s representatives. The company’s securities are not registered under the
                        securities exchange act of 1934, as amended. Any securities of the company to be issued pursuant to a future offering will not be registered under the securities act of 1933, as amended (the “securities act”), or the securities
                        laws of any of the states of the united states. The future offering contemplated by this website will be made in reliance upon an exemption from the registration requirements of the securities act for offers and sales of securities
                        which do not involve any public offering and analogous exemptions under state securities laws. Cautionary Statements Regarding Forward-Looking Information This website contains “forward-looking statements,” which are statements
                        related to future, not past, events. In this context, forward-looking statements often address the Company’s expected future business and financial performance, and often contain words such as “anticipates,” “believes,” “could,”
                        “estimates,” “expects,” “intends,” “may,” “plans,” “predicts,” “projects,” “seeks,” “should,” “will” or other comparable words and phrases. Statements contemplating or making assumptions about actual or potential sales, pricing,
                        economic performance, business prospects, income, revenue or trends also constitute forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements by their nature address matters that are, to different degrees, uncertain. Factors that
                        could cause the Company’s actual results to differ materially include, but are not limited to, a change in general business and economic conditions, legal and regulatory developments that adversely affect the Company’s business,
                        operational and strategic mistakes, a failure to raise sufficient capital, changes in consumer preferences, the impact of competition, failure to identify attractive investment opportunities, loss of key personnel, future commodity
                        prices, terrorist acts, health epidemics or pandemics, changes in demographic trends, availability of employees, unfavorable publicity, acts of God and inflation. These risks and uncertainties as well as risks and uncertainties
                        that are not known to the Company and its representatives may cause the Company’s actual future results to be materially different from those expressed in the forward-looking statements contained herein. The Company and its representatives
                        do not undertake to update its forward-looking statements in this document, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as may be required by law.
